# Next.js Full Stack Project: Deployed

## With Next.js 15 and React 19

This repository contains the completed project with _updated_ code & dependencies for the [Next.js Full Stack Project]() tutorial series.

I plan to check back and update this repository every few months as dependencies need updated.

### Gratitude 

The Next.js Full Stack Project tutorial series is made possible by [Sentry](https://bit.ly/try-sentry-dg). I consider [Sentry](https://bit.ly/try-sentry-dg) to be an essential part of my tech stack, and we will be using [Sentry](https://bit.ly/try-sentry-dg) in this Next.js full stack project.
